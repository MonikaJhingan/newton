Algorithm_key5=An algorithm is a fancy to-do list for a computer. Algorithms take in zero or more inputs and give back one or more outputs.
Algorithm_key6=A recipe is a good example of an algorithm because it tells you what you need to do step by step. It takes inputs (ingredients) and produces an output (the completed dish).
Algorithm_key7=The words 'algorithm' and 'algorism' come from the name of a Persian mathematician called Al-Khwārizmī (Persian: خوارزمی‎‎, c. 780–850).
Algorithm_key8=An algorithm is a sequence of unambiguous instructions for solving a problem, i.e., for obtaining a required output for any legitimate(acceptable) input in a finite amount of time [Levitin, p. 3]. ... Indeed, algorithms are commonly expressed either in a programming language like Pascal or C++, or a pseudocode.
Algorithm_key9=To write a computer program, you have to tell the computer, step by step, exactly what you want it to do. The computer then "executes" the program, following each step mechanically, to accomplish the end goal. ... That's where computer algorithms come in. The algorithm is the basic technique used to get the job done.
Algorithm_key10=A good algorithm should produce the correct outputs for any set of legal inputs. A good algorithm should execute efficiently with the fewest number of steps as possible. A good algorithm should be designed in such a way that others will be able to understand it and modify it to specify solutions to additional problems.
Algorithm_key11=The characteristics of a good algorithm are:
Algorithm_key12=Precision – the steps are precisely stated(defined).
Algorithm_key13=Uniqueness – results of each step are uniquely definedand only depend on the input and the result of the precedingsteps.
Algorithm_key14=Finiteness – the algorithm stops after a finite number ofinstructions are executed.
Algorithm_key15=Input – the algorithm receives input.
Algorithm_key16=Here I've put together a little list, in no particular order.
Algorithm_key17=Merge Sort, Quick Sort and Heap Sort. ...
Algorithm_key18=Fourier Transform and Fast Fourier Transform. ...
Algorithm_key19=Dijkstra's algorithm. ...
Algorithm_key20=RSA algorithm. ...
Algorithm_key21=Secure Hash Algorithm. ...
Algorithm_key22=Integer factorization. ...
Algorithm_key23=Link Analysis. ...
Algorithm_key24=Proportional Integral
