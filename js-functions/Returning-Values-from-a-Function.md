// Defining function

```javascript

function getSum(num1, num2) {
 var total = num1 + num2;
 return total;
}

```

```javascript

// Displaying returned value

var result1 = getSum(6, 20);
console.log(result1) // 0utputs: 26
var result2 = getSum(-5, 17);
console.log(result2) // 0utputs: 12

```
 
To get the result for the above function, we need to console with the function name like we returned total so it will go and save in the function script and we need to call our function within the console and the value we returned here is a number.
 
A function can return a value back to the script that called the function as a result using the return statement. The value may be of any type, including arrays and objects. Whenever a function sees return the function will stop there only , it wonâ€™t execute other statements.
