The declaration of a function starts with the function keyword, followed by the name of the function you want to create, followed by parentheses i.e. (). Function naming can follow all rules as variables.

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

Finally write your function's code between curly brackets {}. Here's the basic syntax for declaring a function:

**Example:**

```javascript

// Defining function

function sayHello(name) {
 return "Hello " + name
}
 
console.log(sayHello("Pragna"))
 
Output :
Hello pragna

```

- How to Call a function

Letâ€™s look at our simple function example again

```javascript

function sayHello(name) {
 return "Hello " + name
}
// Calling function
console.log(sayHello("Pragna"))

```

Once a function is defined it can be called (invoked) from anywhere in the document, by typing its name followed by a set of parentheses, like sayHello() in the example above this is how we call a function.
 
**Explanation:** 

The above code is the example of function. The js function keyword helps us to define a function. The parameter name is like a variable which will take the argument we passed to the function as a value. Return is a keyword which stores the value of a function and gives the value whenever we call the function like console.log(sayHello("Pragna")).

This code output will be Hello Pragna because we are returning Hello with name and name is having Pragna as a value.
