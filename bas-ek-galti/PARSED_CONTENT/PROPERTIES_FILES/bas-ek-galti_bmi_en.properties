bmi_key1=Body Mass Index
bmi_key2=You are assisting a researcher with Python code that computes the Body Mass Index (BMI) of patients. The researcher is concerned because all patients seemingly have unusual and identical BMIs, despite having different physiques. BMI is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in metres.
bmi_key3=Use the debugging principles in this exercise and locate problems with the code. What suggestions would you give the researcher for ensuring any later changes they make work correctly?
bmi_key4=Jab aapka program theek ho jayega, toh uska output yeh hoga:
bmi_key5=Patient's BMI is: 21.604938
Patient's BMI is: 22.160665
Patient's BMI is: 51.903114
