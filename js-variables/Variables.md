**Example:**
```
var myName;

```
**Explanation:**

    In the above example it creates a variable called myName. And variables work like a container to hold the value that we give after equal to (=).

> We tell JavaScript to create or declare a variable by putting the keyword var.
> In javascript we end with semicolons(;). Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.
> In the computer world data is everything which is meaningful to computers. We have so many different types of data types which are string, number, boolean, object , undefined , null etc.,
