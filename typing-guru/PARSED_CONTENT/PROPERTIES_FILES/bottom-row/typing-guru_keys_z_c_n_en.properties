Position your left little finger and left middle finger on the left groove on the keyboard, and your right index finger and right little finger on the right groove of the keyboard. The bottom row keys will be on level below the home row keys. With each of your index, ring, and little fingers, try to reach the keys 
keys_z_c_n_key8=, 
keys_z_c_n_key9= and 
keys_z_c_n_key10=, and try to remember the movement. Look away from the keyboard and feel the grooves with your fingers and try to find them by moving your fingers away.
