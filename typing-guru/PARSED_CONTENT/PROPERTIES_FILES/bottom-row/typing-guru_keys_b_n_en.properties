keys_b_n_key1=name: b and n
keys_b_n_key2=Bottom Row keys b and n
keys_b_n_key3=In this part of the Bottom Rows tutorial, we'll learn the use of keys 
keys_b_n_key4= and 
keys_b_n_key5=.
Position your left index finger on the left groove on the keyboard, and your right index finger on the right groove of the keyboard. The bottom row keys will be on level below the home row keys. With each of your index fingers, try to reach the keys 
keys_b_n_key6= and 
keys_b_n_key7=, and try to remember the movement.
Look away from the keyboard and feel the grooves with your fingers and try to find them by moving your fingers away.
