keys_z_dot_key3=In the last part of the Bottom Rows tutorial, we'll learn the use of keys 
keys_z_dot_key4= and 
keys_z_dot_key5=.
Position your left index finger on the left groove on the keyboard, and your right index finger on the right groove of the keyboard. The bottom row keys will be on level below the home row keys. With each of your little fingers, try to reach the keys 
keys_z_dot_key6= and 
keys_z_dot_key7=, and try to remember the movement. Look away from the keyboard and feel the grooves with your fingers and try to find them by moving your fingers away.
