## Bottom Row keys c,v and m

In this part of the Bottom Rows tutorial, we'll learn the use of keys `c` , `v` and `m`.
Position your left middle finger and left index finger on the left groove on the keyboard, and your right index finger and right little finger on the right groove of the keyboard. Look away from the keyboard and feel the grooves with your fingers and try to find them by moving your fingers away.
