Before going to start understanding this [link](https://www.w3schools.com/code/tryit.asp?filename=GRQZT8140PE2) first. How we changed the document's body background color to Red.

Personally I like colours so much, so now what we are going to do is , we will ask an input to any user and ask him to enter that colour in an input box so that we will add that favourite color of your friend to a box.

These two files below you can use for getting the output :

[https://github.com/vknayak/JS-projects/blob/main/Project4/script.js](https://github.com/vknayak/JS-projects/blob/main/Project4/script.js)

**Script.js**

// write a function named changeColor 
   - get the container1 element by using getElementById and store it in a variable
   - get the input1 value by using getElementById and store it in a variable

Hint: If you want to get any input box value what you will do is just after getting that element by the help of id and write .value to it.


Example:
Var inputBox= document.getElementById(“input1”);
// For getting inputBox value
console.log(inputBox.value);
 
   - update the background color of container1 by the input1 value
   - And clear the input that user enter to empty value
