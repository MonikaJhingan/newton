Holaaaa :) Welcome welcome :) 

## Description for volunteer coordinator:

The volunteer coordinator helps with the coordinations between the volunteers and the organization. Each coordinator will have an organization allocated . All the information about the volunteers and the students that the volunteers will be helping will be shared with the coordinator. The coordinator is the first point of contact when any volunteer has any questions or concerns about the program.

Thanks a lot for showing interest in this opportunity. Jotting down the steps and tasks for his/her role.

## Step 1 - GET THE INFORMATION FROM LTE Spoc
LTE Spoc shares a spreadsheet with the contact information of the volunteers along with student information allocated to each volunteer and an organization coordinator contact.

## Step 2 - CREATE WHATSAPP GROUP
You will create a whatsapp group with all the volunteers + LTE SPOC + Organization coordinator. The organization coordinator will be helping with the coordinations from the organization side. Example scenario - Incase if a student is not answering a call for more than 2 days then the organization coordinator will take care of the communications

## Step 3 - WARM WELCOME AND INTRODUCTIONS
After creating the whats app group with the above, you will introduce yourself and welcome the volunteers. Make sure the org coordinator
shares about the organization and background about the students in the group so that the volunteers feel connected and are empathetic.

## Template to send the group for the welcome message 
Hello I am _NAME_ I am from the spoken english volunteering that you all had signed up for. Very excited to have you onboarded. You all will be helping students from the organization _( share the name )_   . We also have the student coordinator _name of student coordinator_  who will share more details about the organization with you all. Please do introduce yourself dear volunteers. Would love to know you all more.

## Step 4 - SHARE THE CURRICULUM
Once the volunteers have introduced themselves share the curriculum in the group

*Template to send the group for curriculum message* 
Hello this is the link with all the weekly curriculum [Lets teach English](https://www.letsteachenglish.org/curriculum). The curriculum is just a guideline doc and it's nothing strict to follow. Please improvise based on the skill level of the student. The document is to only give you all ideas of what you can talk for an hour with the student. We have been improving this process every week and so week 1 is relatively harder and going forward from week 3 onwards we have two levels in the document - easy level and intermediate level and you will be able to pick and choose. Let me know if you have any questions..

## Step 5 - CONFIRM THE PARTICIPATION FROM THE VOLUNTEERS WHO DID NOT RESPOND IN THE GROUP
Once the introductions and curriculum sharing is completed, please one on one message the volunteers who did not reply back in the group.

*Template to send to the volunteer* - Hello just wanted to follow up with you if you can confirm your participation in the volunteering program after which I will share the student information.

## Step 6 - SHARE STUDENT INFORMATION WITH THE VOLUNTEERS
After step 5 do share the student numbers with the volunteers in a private one on one conversation. Make sure to send the number to only those volunteers who either replied back on the group or to your private message confirming their participation.

*Template to send the group for student information message* - I will be sharing the student information with each volunteer in a one on one conversation to keep the information private.

## Step 7 - Share the student information with the volunteers in a one on one conversation on WhatsApp. VERY IMPORTANT TO SEND THESE NUMBERS PERSONALLY AND NOT IN THE GROUP TO AVOID ANY ISSUES.

## STEP 8 - SHARE THE PROCESS AND NEXT STEPS
Share the following message in the whats app group with all the volunteers for next steps :)

*Template for “next step for volunteers” message* - So now that you all have the contact number and curriculum, the next steps for you all is to call up the student and decide on a particular time and day of the week that's convenient for you both to have the session.**This is a strictly audio call with no video**. You will be calling on the regular phone as the students are coming from a challenging background so having the internet and smartphone is not a norm for them. Usually the first time you call up to set up the time, there is a possibility that the student will not pick up as they share the phone with the family. So please be patient. Try for a minimum of 3 days to call them up and if not let the group know and the organization coordinator can help with the communication :) You all are ready to get this party started.

After every session with the student, please fill up this brief call report
form - [REPORT FORM](https://forms.gle/noNkfRDRNXmjSPMS9)

## STEP 9 - WEEKLY TRACKING and VOLUNTEER REPLACEMENT

To help keep track of calls, please encourage the volunteers to share their experience after the call every week in the group. Sharing in the group encourages other volunteers as well. It helps forms a community :) If any volunteer hasn’t shared at the end of the week please do reach out to them one on one to find our about the call status. **AS A VOLUNTEER COORDINATOR PLEASE UPDATE THE WEEKLY CALL STATUS FOR EACH VOLUNTEER IN YOUR RESPECTIVE SPREADSHEET AS WELL SO WE CAN TRACK. MAKE SURE THE VOLUNTEERS FILLS UP THE FEEDBACK FORM** : [feedback form](https://forms.gle/noNkfRDRNXmjSPMS9)

Occasionally, a volunteer will need to drop out or will not be reachable. Please request for replacement volunteers by filling up this [form](https://forms.gle/bnvosZ2bHcinqcYG9).

## STEP 10 - End-of-program SURVEY
Once a volunteer completes all the 15 calls, please ask them to fill out the End-of-Prorgram survey which can be found [here](https://forms.gle/YGU4sZvMuqRdjKGZ9)
