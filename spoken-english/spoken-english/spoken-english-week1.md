### Next 30 mins
1) About 10 mins
Describe a day in your life in this past week !
( Starting from when you woke up until the time you fall asleep )
First the volunteer describes the day !
Then the child describes the day !


2) About next 10 mins
GAME TIME : Be it an adult or a child, playing a game is always exciting !
Week 1 game is called “The Imitation Game”
This technique will help the children to enhance their pronunciation skills :)
Rules are very simple -
The child repeats after you. Understand the pace and break down the sentences
below accordingly. Also at any point if the child doesn’t understand the meaning of a word please define it.


### Short Story -
This story is about a Critically endangered parrot called kākāpō - also the
word’s fattest parrot !
Who doesn't love a cute fat parrot ?
The kākāpō is a flightless species of parrot native to New Zealand. Though it once
was one of New Zealand's most abundant animals, heavy hunting reduced it
numbers to just 147 living adults today.
The nocturnal, flightless parrot is one of New Zealanders' favourite birds, and is known for its charismatic nature and owl-like face.
This year, however, the kākāpō had a record breaking breeding season with 60
more chicks expected to make it to adulthood, nearly double the previous record! 
The chicks will be raised in predator-free sanctuaries to give them the best chance
of survival.
Species like these make protecting our forests so rewarding. Healthier habitats
means more chubby parrots!
3) At the end of every session let’s teach them one word and their homework would
be to try to use the word in a sentence when they talk to their friends/teachers in the
school and make a note of how many times did they use it.
**Word of this week -**
abandon - noun
Meaning - complete lack of inhibition or restraint.
