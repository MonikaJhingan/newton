Now that you've decided to teach students, lets see how you can get there and get started! 

### Step 2 - Creating a Class

[Class Scheduler](https://www.merakilearn.org/class, "Class Scheduler"), on this page, you'll find all the classes created by other facilitators. You can recheck the date and time before creating your class, to ensure it doesn't clash with someone else's, and that your Classes are varied. Eg: Facilitator **A** creates Class 1 - Introduction to Python on Thursday, at 4pm. Then you can create your Class 1 - Introduction to Python on Saturday or Sunday, to space out similar sessions. 

You can click on the *Create a Class* button on the left hand side corner, to create your class. *(Please use the nomenclature mentioned in the [curriculum table](https://www.merakilearn.org/course/145/exercise/3523))*

Once you have completed creating a class. You shall get an email and/or a calendar invite. You may use that to join the Google Meet you've created for your class. You can use this [Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/auto-admit-for-google-mee/epemkdedgaoeeobdjmkmhhhbjemckmgb/related?hl=en, "Auto Admit Extension") to Auto Admit students to the Meet you've scheduled.

> It would be ideal for you to conduct a minimum of 2 classes per week, and schedule your sessions for atleast 3 weeks from the first class. This helps the student know when to expect your classes. You can always go back and edit the class, if you have to change the time or date of the class.
