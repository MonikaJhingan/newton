# Curriculum Structure

The **_8 courses in Python_** are divided into **_22 Workshop Classes_**. We expect you to follow this Class division, to ensure that the sequence of learning is maintained, and a child has an opportunity to come back and attend only those specific classes she had doubts in, or had missed it for whatever reasons. 

> Please use this nomenclature of Class Title to ensure uniformity in the learning pace of the students. 

|Class Title|Class Description|Expected Outcomes|
|---|---|---|
|Class 1 - Introduction to Python|What do Computers do? What is Programming? Why should you become a Programmar? What is the use of Programming? Basic Definitions|This introductory module should help you introduce yourself and create a connection with the students. It should cover **WHY** the student must learn Programming and how it would benefit them. Use the initial classes to create curiosity in the students. You can show them what one can achieve using programming, ask them if they would want to create something like that in the future, and let them know the stepping stones to get there.|
|Class 2 - Introduction to Python and Definitions|Continue with the Basic Definitions, Why should you learn Python? What are the features of Python? How to start with Python? How to write a comment? What is Indentation? What are the Applications of Python?|This module shall continue with the definitions of the previous class. Share an understanding of why we use Python to start learning programming. This module should aim to create intrigue and interest in the students to learn Python.|
|Class 3 - Variables|What is a Variable? What are the various naming rules? How can we assign values to variables? Practice Questions and Quizzes|Spend an entire class on making the student understand the concept of Variables, as it is the first step to learning coding. You can share live examples, show them multiple variable names and make them choose the correct one based on the rules they've learnt. You can also ask them to share their screen, and write on the Python compiler called Playground, on the Meraki Android Application.|
|Class 4 - Data Types|What are Data type? What are Predefined Data types in Python? What are the various Numeric Data types - Integer, Float, Complex? Practice Questions|This module should introduce the different types of Data Types used in Python, and students should be clear with concepts related to Numeric Data Types.|
|Class 5 - Data Types|In depth explanation of String Data type, Boolean Data type, Data Type Conversion. Practice Questions and Quizzes|A student should be familiar with Data types and should be able to answer questions related to data types and conversions.| 
|Class 6 - Operators|What are Operators? What are the different types of Operators in Python? In depth explanation of Arithmetic Operators, with examples. Operator Precedence. Practice Questions and Quizzes|
|Class 7 - Operators|What are Assignment Operators, Comparison Operators and Logical Operators? Practice Questions and Quizzes|
|Class 8 - Operators and Revision|An introduction to Bitwise, Membership and Identity Operators. Revision and Practice Questions on Operators, Data Types and Variables|The basics of the child should be clear. Despite the complexity, Bitwise, Membership and Identity operators can be introduced, which would come in handy for future topics. Post this class we shall go on to functionalities like If-Else, Loops, etc.|
|Class 9 - If Else|Why do we use conditions? What is a condition? How to use If-Else? What are flowcharts and how should we prepare them? How should we write an If-Else code?|This module should introduce conditions and why we use them, using live examples. Students should be able to write a basic If-Else code after this class. You can ask them to share their screen and code on Playground.|
|Class 10 - If Else|Introduction and examples of If-Elif. Dry run code for revision. Practice Questions and Quizzes|A child should be able to write codes on their own for simple If-Else conditions. You may ask them to screenshare, or dictate the code to you.|
|Class 11 - If Else|Nested If-Else. Practice Questions and Quizzes| 
|Class 12 - If Else|Revision and Practice Questions on If-Else Condition|You can make this an interactive session by posing multiple questions to the students and asking each child to solve it. You can also have them choose the correct code through MCQs, or True or False questions. A child should have a clear understandig of this module, to move forward.|
|Class 13 - Loops|What are Loops? What are the Advantages of using Loops? What is Counter? Examples of Counters. Different types of loops in Python - While loop. Practice Questions and Quizzes|
|Class 14 - Loops|Loop control statements such as continue, break, pass. Nested while loops. Share live examples and Practice Questions.|
|Class 15 - Loops|Basics of For Loops. Revise Membership operator. For Loop using Sequence (String) and using Range(). Practice Questions and Quizzes|
|Class 16 - Loops|
|Class 17 - List|
|Class 18 - List|
|Class 19 - List|
|Class 20 - List|
|Class 21 - Dictionary|
|Class 22 - Dictionary|
