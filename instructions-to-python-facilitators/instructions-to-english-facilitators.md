It is divided into 15 Workshop Classes. We expect you to follow this Class division, to ensure that the sequence of learning is maintained, and a child has an opportunity to come back and attend only those specific classes she had doubts in, or had missed it for whatever reasons.

### Step 3 - Creating a Class
The next step is clearly to [Create a Class](https://www.merakilearn.org/class)! On this page, you'll find all the other classes created by other facilitators. You can recheck the date and time before creating your class, to ensure it doesn't clash with someone else's, and that your Classes are varied. Eg: Facilitator A creates *Class 1 - Introduction* on *Thursday, at 4pm*. Then you can create your Class 1 - Introduction on Saturday or Sunday, to space out similar sessions.

You can click on the Create a Class button on the left hand side corner, to create your class. (Please use the nomenclature mentioned in the above table)

Once you have completed creating a class. You shall get an email and/or a calendar invite. You may use that to join the Google Meet you've created for your class. You can use this [Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/auto-admit-for-google-mee/epemkdedgaoeeobdjmkmhhhbjemckmgb/related?hl=en,) to Auto Admit students to the Meet you've scheduled.

**NOTE** : This will be a recusrive Session, meaning 1 volunteer will be teaching 5 students, and same students will be taught for the rest of the weeks as well to bring a cohort culture. Currently the slots available are *Weekdays/Weekends 7-9pm*.


The class conduct has to be done in following manner : 

1. Create first class over Meraki. Limit student entry to 5-7 only. Gather student email-ids, send them calendar invites for the second class. *Do not create second class over Meraki*
2. Repeat the calendar invite for the following classes.
3. This is a temporary solution till the *"Recursive Class"* - feature gets updated on Meraki.


### Step 4 - Classes with Students

.. Use the first five minutes to understand their learning journey on Meraki, and encourage them to self learn using Live Classes only as an extra help.
.. Use the next ten minutes to recapitulate and revise previous topics, and solve their previous queries.
.. You can use the second half of the class to share problems for the students to solve. It could be in the form of MCQs, True or False, Sentence Formation, or even Questions.
.. You can assign some homework or prework a student must do before the next class, such as the next topic they can read/ study and come for in the next class.
.. Keep checking in with the students if they've understood or no in between to ensure its a dialogue and not a monologue. You can try to make it as innovative and interactive as you wish to!
