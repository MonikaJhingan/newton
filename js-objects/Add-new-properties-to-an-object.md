Here's how we would add a isGood property to myHome:

```javascript

myHome.isGood= true;

console.log(myHome);

// output

{
   name: ‘my Villa’,
   location:"Mumbai",
   Colour:"black",
   Owner:”sharukh khan”,
   neighbours: ["everything!"],
   isGood:true
}

```

If you see, the new property isGood is added in the object.
