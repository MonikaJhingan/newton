review-of-python’s-time-functions_key2=Review of Python’s Time Functions
review-of-python’s-time-functions_key3=Dates and times in Python can involve quite a few different data types and functions. Here’s a review of the three different types of values used to represent time:
review-of-python’s-time-functions_key4=A Unix epoch timestamp (used by the time module) is a float or integer value of the number of seconds since 12 AM on January 1, 1970, UTC.
review-of-python’s-time-functions_key5=A datetime object (of the datetime module) has integers stored in the attributes year, month, day, hour, minute, and second.
review-of-python’s-time-functions_key6=A timedelta object (of the datetime module) represents a time duration, rather than a specific moment.
review-of-python’s-time-functions_key7=Here’s a review of time functions and their parameters and return values:
review-of-python’s-time-functions_key8=The time.time() function returns an epoch timestamp float value of the current moment.
review-of-python’s-time-functions_key9=The time.sleep(seconds) function stops the program for the amount of seconds specified by the seconds argument.
review-of-python’s-time-functions_key10=The datetime.datetime(year, month, day, hour, minute, second) function returns a datetime object of the moment specified by the arguments. If hour, minute, or second arguments are not provided, they default to 0.
review-of-python’s-time-functions_key11=The datetime.datetime.now() function returns a datetime object of the current moment.
review-of-python’s-time-functions_key12=The datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(epoch) function returns a datetime object of the moment represented by the epoch timestamp argument.
review-of-python’s-time-functions_key13=The datetime.timedelta(weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds, microseconds) function returns a timedelta object representing a duration of time. The function’s keyword arguments are all optional and do not include month or year.
review-of-python’s-time-functions_key14=The total_seconds() method for timedelta objects returns the number of seconds the timedelta object represents.
review-of-python’s-time-functions_key15=The strftime(format) method returns a string of the time represented by the datetime object in a custom format that’s based on the format string. See Table 15-1 for the format details.
review-of-python’s-time-functions_key16=The datetime.datetime.strptime(time_string, format) function returns a datetime object of the moment specified by time_string, parsed using the format string argument. See Table 15-1 for the format details.
