converting-types-with-the-list()-and-tuple()-functions_key2=Converting Types with the list() and tuple() Functions
converting-types-with-the-list()-and-tuple()-functions_key3=Just like how str(42) will return '42', the string representation of the integer 42, the functions list() and tuple() will return list and tuple versions of the values passed to them. Enter the following into the interactive shell, and notice that the return value is of a different data type than the value passed:
converting-types-with-the-list()-and-tuple()-functions_key4=Converting a tuple to a list is handy if you need a mutable version of a tuple value.

converting-types-with-the-list()-and-tuple()-functions_key6=As you’ve seen, variables store strings and integer values. Enter the following into the interactive shell:
converting-types-with-the-list()-and-tuple()-functions_key7=You assign 42 to the spam variable, and then you copy the value in spam and assign it to the variable cheese. When you later change the value in spam to 100, this doesn’t affect the value in cheese. This is because spam and cheese are different variables that store different values.
converting-types-with-the-list()-and-tuple()-functions_key8=But lists don’t work this way. When you assign a list to a variable, you are actually assigning a list reference to the variable. A reference is a value that points to some bit of data, and a list reference is a value that points to a list. Here is some code that will make this distinction easier to understand. Enter this into the interactive shell:
converting-types-with-the-list()-and-tuple()-functions_key9=This might look odd to you. The code changed only the cheese list, but it seems that both the cheese and spam lists have changed.
converting-types-with-the-list()-and-tuple()-functions_key10=When you create the list ❶, you assign a reference to it in the spam variable. But the next line ❷ copies only the list reference in spam to cheese, not the list value itself. This means the values stored in spam and cheese now both refer to the same list. There is only one underlying list because the list itself was never actually copied. So when you modify the first element of cheese ❸, you are modifying the same list that spam refers to.
converting-types-with-the-list()-and-tuple()-functions_key11=Remember that variables are like boxes that contain values. The previous figures in this chapter show that lists in boxes aren’t exactly accurate because list variables don’t actually contain lists—they contain references to lists. (These references will have ID numbers that Python uses internally, but you can ignore them.) Using boxes as a metaphor for variables, Figure 4-4 shows what happens when a list is assigned to the spam variable.
converting-types-with-the-list()-and-tuple()-functions_key12=spam = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] stores a reference to a list, not the actual list.
converting-types-with-the-list()-and-tuple()-functions_key13=Then, in Figure 4-5, the reference in spam is copied to cheese. Only a new reference was created and stored in cheese, not a new list. Note how both references refer to the same list.
converting-types-with-the-list()-and-tuple()-functions_key14=spam = cheese copies the reference, not the list.
converting-types-with-the-list()-and-tuple()-functions_key15=When you alter the list that cheese refers to, the list that spam refers to is also changed, because both cheese and spam refer to the same list. You can see this in Figure
converting-types-with-the-list()-and-tuple()-functions_key16=cheese[1] = 'Hello!' modifies the list that both variables refer to.
converting-types-with-the-list()-and-tuple()-functions_key17=Variables will contain references to list values rather than list values themselves. But for strings and integer values, variables simply contain the string or integer value. Python uses references whenever variables must store values of mutable data types, such as lists or dictionaries. For values of immutable data types such as strings, integers, or tuples, Python variables will store the value itself.
converting-types-with-the-list()-and-tuple()-functions_key18=Although Python variables technically contain references to list or dictionary values, people often casually say that the variable contains the list or dictionary.
converting-types-with-the-list()-and-tuple()-functions_key19=Passing References
converting-types-with-the-list()-and-tuple()-functions_key20=References are particularly important for understanding how arguments get passed to functions. When a function is called, the values of the arguments are copied to the parameter variables. For lists (and dictionaries, which I’ll describe in the next chapter), this means a copy of the reference is used for the parameter. To see the consequences of this, open a new file editor window, enter the following code, and save it as passingReference.py:
converting-types-with-the-list()-and-tuple()-functions_key21=Notice that when eggs() is called, a return value is not used to assign a new value to spam. Instead, it modifies the list in place, directly. When run, this program produces the following output:
converting-types-with-the-list()-and-tuple()-functions_key22=[1, 2, 3, 'Hello']
Even though spam and someParameter contain separate references, they both refer to the same list. This is why the append('Hello') method call inside the function affects the list even after the function call has returned.
converting-types-with-the-list()-and-tuple()-functions_key23=Keep this behavior in mind: Forgetting that Python handles list and dictionary variables this way can lead to confusing bugs.
