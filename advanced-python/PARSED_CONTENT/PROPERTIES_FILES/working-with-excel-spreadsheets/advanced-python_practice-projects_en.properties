practice-projects_key3=For practice, write programs that perform the following tasks.
practice-projects_key4=Multiplication Table Maker
Create a program multiplicationTable.py that takes a number N from the command line and creates an N×N multiplication table in an Excel spreadsheet. For example, when the program is run like this:
practice-projects_key5=py multiplicationTable.py 6
... it should create a spreadsheet that looks like Figure 12-11.
practice-projects_key6=Figure 12-11. A multiplication table generated in a spreadsheet
practice-projects_key7=Row 1 and column A should be used for labels and should be in bold.
practice-projects_key8=Blank Row Inserter
practice-projects_key9=Create a program blankRowInserter.py that takes two integers and a filename string as command line arguments. Let’s call the first integer N and the second integer M. Starting at row N, the program should insert M blank rows into the spreadsheet. For example, when the program is run like this:
practice-projects_key10=python blankRowInserter.py 3 2 myProduce.xlsx
... the “before” and “after” spreadsheets should look like Figure 12-12.
practice-projects_key11=Figure 12-12. Before (left) and after (right) the two blank rows are inserted at row 3
practice-projects_key12=You can write this program by reading in the contents of the spreadsheet. Then, when writing out the new spreadsheet, use a for loop to copy the first N lines. For the remaining lines, add M to the row number in the output spreadsheet.
