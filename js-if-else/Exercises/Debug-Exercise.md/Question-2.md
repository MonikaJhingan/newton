```js
var number = 12;
 
if(Number%3 === 0){
   console.log("choco")
}
elif(number % 7){
   console.log("late")
}
elif(a%3==0 and a%7==0) {
   console.log("Chocolate")
}
else {
   console.log("Not divisible by 3 , 7")
}

```
Output should show chocolate only when it is divisible by both 3 and 7 and it should not show choco and late to the same number.
